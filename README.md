Project name:
Sudoku Game

Description:
For this project we intend to create an online sudoku player. This is a puzzle game played on a 9x9 grid where each row and column is filled with numbers 1-9 and canâ€™t repeat within each row or column. 
Users will be able to generate a playing board, and play the game under a timer. The application will gather the date played, and time it took to complete the puzzle to store in the database. 
Users will then be able to retrieve their game statistics/win data from the database and it must be displayed on a dashboard.
